Unsolved Problems and Future Work
Currently, the game has a limited number of places and monsters. In the future, more content can be added to make the game more engaging and diverse.
The game lacks a proper story and progression system. Implementing a more coherent storyline and quests would enhance the player experience.
Players can only chat with NPCs using a basic input box. A more advanced conversation system could be implemented to create meaningful interactions with NPCs.
The game can be expanded with a more complex combat system, including skills, abilities, and equipment.
Implementing a save/load feature would allow players to return to their game at a later time.
