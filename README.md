Technologies Used
HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (ES6) for front-end development
Node.js and Express for back-end development
OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo for generating dynamic NPC dialogues
Approach
The game is designed with a simple user interface, consisting of a game title, stats box, place buttons container, and other elements for the player to interact with. The game logic is implemented in JavaScript, handling player actions, generating places, and managing game events. The server-side uses Node.js and Express to handle API calls to OpenAI for generating NPC dialogues.

Unsolved Problems and Future Work
Currently, the game has a limited number of places and monsters. In the future, more content can be added to make the game more engaging and diverse.
The game lacks a proper story and progression system. Implementing a more coherent storyline and quests would enhance the player experience.
Players can only chat with NPCs using a basic input box. A more advanced conversation system could be implemented to create meaningful interactions with NPCs.
The game can be expanded with a more complex combat system, including skills, abilities, and equipment.
Implementing a save/load feature would allow players to return to their game at a later time.
